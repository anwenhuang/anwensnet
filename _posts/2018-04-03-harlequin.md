## The bright colors of a harlequin duck captivated me the instant I saw them.

I created this composition of a male harlequin duck for the annual Federal Junior Duck Stamp Contest hosted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 

The piece is done entirely in colored pencil.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
