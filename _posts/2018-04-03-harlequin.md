## The bright colors of a harlequin duck captivated me the instant I saw them.

I created this composition of a male harlequin duck calling for the annual Federal Junior Duck Stamp Contest hosted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 

The piece is done entirely in colored pencil. From the small water droplets on the duck's body to the subtle colors in its beak, there were countless small details I worked to capture.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
