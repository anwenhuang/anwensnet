## This piece was painted on a special yellow-tinted half-raw sheet of rice paper.

This allowed the white crane to stand out, while also providing the overall color scheme. The crane appears very striking against the wilted lotus leaves, which, although brown, still have elements of life through the addition of aqua colors. 

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 25"
