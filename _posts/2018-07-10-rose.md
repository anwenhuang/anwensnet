## This piece was done plein-air style, on-scene at a local garden.

I used watercolors to paint several roses that caught my eye with their bright yet pale colors. Capturing the delicacy of the petals and the sunlight was challenging, but I tackled this by limiting myself to light colors.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
