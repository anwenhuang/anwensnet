## The eccentric colors of king eiders are unmatched by any other duck specices.

This is why I chose to draw them for the 2018 Federal Junior Duck Stamp Contest, in which I won an honorable mention. Using colored pencil, I drew two male ducks taking flight, carefully shading every detail. Then, I painted the background with watercolor and added the splashes with white acrylic paint.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
