## The eccentric colors of king eiders are unmatched by any other duck species.

This is why I chose to draw them for the 2018 Federal Junior Duck Stamp Contest, in which I won an honorable mention. Using colored pencil, I drew two male ducks taking flight, then I painted the background with watercolor and added the detail of water splashes with white acrylic paint.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
