## The idea of family is a strong pillar in Chinese values and inspired this piece.

I painted a complete chicken family, with the striking rooster, hen, and babies. Unlike Western art, where things are usually sketched out carefully before color is applied, Chinese brush painting does not involve detailed sketching, so getting the proportions right was a daunting task that took many rounds of practice to master.

Over top, I wrote a Chinese phrase that means "happy family" in a traditional calligraphy font.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 53"
