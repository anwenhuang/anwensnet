## Experimenting with colors, I created this piece to create a fictional yet beautiful depiction of peonies.

I used a specific peony painting technique, first laying down a blue undertone before adding white petals over top. This piece was done with Chinese watercolors and ink on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 18"
