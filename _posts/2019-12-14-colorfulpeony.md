## Although somewhat unrealistic, the colors in this piece give it a celebratory aura.

Using bright colors made this piece extremely fun to design and paint as I thought about what composition and color scheme would look best. I painted this using the traditional peony painting technique, using Chinese watercolors and ink on fully raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 25" x 15"
