## Another cheerful piece, these colorful peonies may be unrealistically colored, but are a joy to look at nonetheless.

I had painted a similar color scheme with peonies before (see Colorful Peonies 1), and decided to try again with the addition of butterflies. This time, I pushed the vibrancy of the colors even further, really exaggerating to bring happiness into the piece. It was done using Chinese watercolors and ink on fully-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 26" x 16"
