## This piece was published in the August 2020 issue of Colored Pencil Magazine.

It is a colored pencil study of a box turtle I submitted as a part of the magazine's monthly, worldwide colored pencil contest. I placed first and my piece was featured in their next monthly issue. 

I spent weeks rendering the shell and the turtle's skin texture, capturing every detail to make the piece as realistic as possible.

Dimensions (H x W): 11" x 9"
