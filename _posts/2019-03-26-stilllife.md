## This piece is a graphite still life focused on texture.

It features flowers from my yard, gourds leftover from a Halloween pumpkin patch, and a pine cone I found on the street. The variety of textures spanning from the delicate flower petals to the shiny and stiff metal vase were super fun to render.  However, during the process of creating the piece, the gourds started to rot, hence the title of the piece.

This piece won a Scholastic Gold Key.
