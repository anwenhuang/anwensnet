## This piece aims to capture the tranquility of the Hokkaido Japanese Garden in Saratoga.

I painted this while at the garden using acrylics on canvas. I experimented with rougher strokes to create a livelier feel to the piece. However, there are still small details in the foreground to help it stand out.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
