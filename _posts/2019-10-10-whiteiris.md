## The bright white flowers really stand out against the dark blue-green leaves.

I painted this piece on fully raw rice paper, although pieces with outlines are typically reserved for half-raw or detail rice paper. Using fully raw rice paper allowed me to have a more "inky" feeling with more water being absorbed. A large brush was used to paint the large leaves.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 20"
