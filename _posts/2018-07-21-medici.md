## This is a study of Michelangelo's sculpture bust of Giuliano de' Medici.

The original sculpture is located in the Medici Chapel in Florence, Italy. After seeing the sculpture in-person, I was struck by the chiseled facial features and intricately curled hair and decided to render a drawing back home. Using a plaster cast of the sculpture, I produced this still life using graphite pencils. 

Dimensions (H x W): 20" x 16"
