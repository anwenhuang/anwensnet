## This piece is a copy of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1880 portrait, Little Irene.

Renoir's portrait masterfully captured the youthful innocence of his subject, and I wanted to attempt to recreate the same feeling. Painting the girl's dress and hair were particular challenges as they were both textured yet delicate and soft. I used oil paints on canvas for this piece.

Dimensions (H x W): 20" x 16"
