## I rarely paint magnolia flowers, so this painting was a pretty new experience.

However, I utilized similar techniques and took the time to render each petal. After perfecting the outlines, I filled each petal with a pale sage green before also blending in a light white. 

The contrast between the bright flowers and dark leaves make the piece more striking. I used Chinese watercolors and ink on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 24"
