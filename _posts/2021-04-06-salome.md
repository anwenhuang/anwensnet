## This piece explores violent deaths, my fear of them, and their prevalence in our society.  
I used ballpoint pen to create a copy of Caravaggio's 1607/1610 painting, "Salome with the Head of John the Baptist." I wanted to capture the eerie and disheartening feel many of Caravaggio's pieces have by focusing on the strong contrast and lighting. 

To me, the original piece has an aura of disassociation â€” none of the subjects seem particularly emotional or scared by what they have witnessed. This plays into the text I have layered over top, in which I state that killers, or people complicit to killing, are everywhere in our world.
