## Despite hardly being in the snow, I enjoy painting winter scenes.

They use very limited colors (mainly only white, indigo, and ink), yet manage to create a dynamic feel. I focused on drawing the small details, from the birch trunk to the houses and fishing boats. This was done with Chinese watercolors and ink on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 25" x 15"
