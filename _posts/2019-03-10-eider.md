## With a striking jet black top and pale sage green cheek, the head of a male common eider is one of the most peculiar amongst ducks.

Native to the northern coasts of Europe, North America, and Eastern Siberia, this species instantly caught my eye when I saw pictures of it online.

I chose it as my subject species for the 2019 Federal Junior Duck Stamp Contest and paired a male and female together. Rather than following a standard angle, I made my composition a back-view of the pair, allowing me to highlight the feather formation.

The ducks are done in colored pencil, while the water background is painted with watercolors.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
