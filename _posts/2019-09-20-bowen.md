## This is a portrait of my little brother.

It is using oil paint on canvas and is based on a photograph my father took during a flower festival in the Netherlands. I really wanted to convey the joy of the moment and worked to use bright and warm tones throughout the piece. The flowers gave it a nice touch by adding even more vibrancy into the scene. I also focused on the subtle gradations in my brother's skin to create a "glowing" effect.

Dimensions (H x W): 20" x 16"
