## This is a portrait of my little brother.

It is oil paint on canvas and is based on a photograph my dad took during a flower festival in the Netherlands. I really wanted to convey the joy of the moment and worked to use bright and warm tones throughout the piece. The flowers add even more vibrancy to the scene.

Dimensions (H x W): 20" x 16"
