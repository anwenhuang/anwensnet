## This fairy was featured in a fairy drawing book, and her dynamic surroundings and outfit inspired me to create a copy.

The fairy and plants were done in colored pencil, while the background was painted using watercolors. To create a fresh scene fit for this fairy, I used bright colors.

Dimensions (H x W): 11" x 9"
