-----------------

## Done in colored pencil with a digital background, this piece explores the sometimes gruesome nature of loss.

I wanted to render the blood as realistic as possible, so as to create a feeling of discomfort in the viewer (like my feeling toward a violent death). 

Dimensions (H x W): 11" x 14"
