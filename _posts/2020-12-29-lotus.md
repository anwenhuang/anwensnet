## I don't traditionally paint in just ink, but wanted to try with this lotus composition, a subject often done without color.

Painting the massive leaves required a large brush and even larger stroke. Generally, about halfway through the stroke the brush would dry out, forcing me to reload with ink and try again. Outlining the lotus flowers were another challenge that required lengthy practice to get the petals to fall just right. This piece was done entirely in ink on fully-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 53" x 27"
