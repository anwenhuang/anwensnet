## I don't traditionally paint in just ink, but I wanted to try with this lotus composition, a subject often done without color.

Painting the massive leaves required a huge brush and fast movements to prevent the ink from drying out midway. Outlining the lotus flowers was another challenge that required lengthy practice to get my desired petal shape. This piece was done entirely in ink on fully-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 53" x 27"
