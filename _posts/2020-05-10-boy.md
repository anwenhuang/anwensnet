## This piece is a portrait of a young boy.

It was created using colored pencils as a part of Colored Pencil Magazine's Monthly Challenge, in which artists around the world were given a copyright-free image to draw.

The original photograph actually had two boys, but I decided to focus in on just one. I practiced drawing realistic eyes and skin colors.

Dimensions (H x W): 14" x 11"
