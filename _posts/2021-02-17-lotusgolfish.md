## This piece is a colorful combination of lotuses and goldfish.

The goldfish and lotus flowers required a great detail of patience and attention to detail to paint as I had to carefully apply color in the right spots. After getting the main subjects down, I added a background color to give the piece a more complete look.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 16"
