## I still can't spell chrysanthemum without a quick Google search, but that didn't stop me from creating this piece.

The delicate petals required a lot of practice to place in the proper formations and a combination of a firm yet flexible grip was key. The vibrant violet of the flowers contrasts nicely with the dark straw basket, creating a sophisticated color scheme.

This piece was done using Chinese water colors and ink on fully-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 16"
