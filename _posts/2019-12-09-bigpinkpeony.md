## This piece captures the delicacy and warmth of spring flowers.

Peonies are a common subject in Chinese art and one of my favorite things to paint. 

For this piece, I used a special technique: rather than painting the peonies stroke by stroke using pink, I first set down circles of peach on the paper. When these circles were half-dry, I began painting on petals using white. This helped to create the mystical and hazy feeling the peonies have. All of the painting was done with Chinese watercolors and ink.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 53"
