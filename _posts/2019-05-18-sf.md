## This piece is a plein-air painting done in San Francisco.

It was a foggy (and cold) day at Land's End, and although I had set out to paint the Golden Gate Bridge, it was hardly visible under the dense clouds. Instead, I decided to turn my easel around 180 degrees and paint the cliffs behind me. I mixed toned down colors with my acrylic paint and tried to get the tranquil aura onto the canvas.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
