## This is a take on the Chinese saying and folkstory "fish leaping over dragon gate."

The story deals with the overcoming of challenges and the growth that comes with them. I first did a rough outline of the fish using ink before painting it with Chinese watercolors. For the waves, I used a large flat brush to create broad strokes. The piece was painted on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 16"
