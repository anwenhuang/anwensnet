featured: true

## Working with the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation and UCSF professor Li Zhang, I analyzed customer experience data from their annual burn survivor summer camp.

We performed statistical tests like the McNemar's test on survey data collected from campers. Our analysis revealed that campers desired more virtual bonding experiences and helped shape future programs, showing me the real-world impact of data science. It was amazing to know that my work helped others in my community. This abstract was awarded a panel presentation by the American Burn Association.
