## This piece explores the beauty of space, and how it gives me perspective on life.

When I think about how vast our universe is, dying loses its fearful quality. It is just another phase that everything will go through, from the ants under my feet to the stars in the sky. 

I attempted to capture space the way I see it, as a magical realm filled to the brim with wonders.

The skull and planets were painted with watercolors. I then added text expressing the reassurance space provides digitally.
