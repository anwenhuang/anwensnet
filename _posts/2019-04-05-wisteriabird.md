## In a re-hashing of this theme (see previous wisteria and bird piece), I worked to create a misty feeling.

After painting the wisteria, I added faint background colors to achieve the feel. The birds were then added to be co-subjects in the piece. This was done using Chinese watercolors and ink on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 16"
