## In the summer of 2024, I was a research intern at UCSF.

I worked under UCSF professor Li Zhang's group to research if we could accurately predict what antigen peptides a given T-cell receptor (TCR) would bind to. This work is critical in developing more potent immunotherapies. Our paper was published in Briefings in Bioinformatics.
