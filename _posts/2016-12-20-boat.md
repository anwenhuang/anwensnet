## This is an acrylic copy of Paul Signac's 1888 painting, "The Bridge at Asnieres."

Signac's distinct style using scattered dots to create scenes interested me immensely and I wanted to try it on my own. I had never done anything like this before and it was intially tough to adjust. Going dot by dot was time-consuming, but at the same time very satisfying.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 11"
