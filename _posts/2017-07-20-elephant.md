## This is a creative play on colors.

I found a reference of elephants online and decided to try a more abstract approach. I had to see past the gray in the photographs and pick out warm tones, from which I mixed (extremely) exaggerated hues. It was difficult to decide what colors to use for the shadows and lights and I was initially concerned that the elephants would be hard to discern with the crazy colors.

The piece was done entirely in watercolor and in the end, was a fun experience where I got to roam freely with colors.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
