## 2017 is the year of the rooster under the Chinese calendar.

I created this piece to celebrate the forthcoming year. It is a colored pencil rendering of a rooster, an animal I was excited to draw because of its vibrant colors and interesting texture. Although everything is feathery, different parts of the body are adorned with different types of feathers, each of which must be drawn differently.

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
