## Once again using common subjects, koi fish and lotus flowers, I created this composition in the springtime.

Having already painted both subjects quite a lot, I was quite comfortable with the painting process. However, as always, getting the massive lotus leaves just right was still a difficult task, as was placing the flower petals in a nice formation. This piece was created with Chinese watercolors and ink on fully-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 53"
