## This piece is an interpretation of pond flowers.

I really loved the purple color these flowers had and decided to contrast them with the blue-green leaves. I first outlined the flowers and leaves with ink before coloring them in with Chinese watercolors. The little fish were added to create a more interesting and dynamic composition. This was done using half-raw rice paper, which absorbs less water and allows for more details.

Dimensions (H x W): 27" x 16"
