## This style of painting is known as detail-painting, and involves painting intricate outlines before adding in color.

It requires a special type of rice paper, known as detail paper. On it, I used Chinese watercolors and ink to paint the peonies and leaves, a time-consuming process as I had to create outlines and carefully color them in. 

I also used gold metallic paint to add extra flair to the piece. I had never used this on Chinese paintings before, but the results were super cool. It gave the piece a more celebratory feeling and helped the peonies stand out. 

Dimensions (H x W): 24" x 16"
