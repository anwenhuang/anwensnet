## In the summer of 2024, I was a machine learning and deep learning research intern at UCSF.

I worked under professor Li Zhang's group researching how to predict T-cell receptor (TCR) and antigen peptide binding. T-cells play a critical role in the human immune response by binding to antigen peptides to destroy them. There is a wide variety of TCRs which each bind to specific antigens. Being able to accurately predict this binding behavior will help us create more potent and targeted immunotherapies. I worked to compare our group's innovative deep learning pipeline with traditional machine learning methods and found that our pipeline yieled accurate results with great efficiency.

Our paper was published in Briefings in Bioinformatics in July 2025.
