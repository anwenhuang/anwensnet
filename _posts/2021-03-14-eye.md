## This is a creative exploration of the complexity of our universe.  
When looked at closely, one will discover that each element of the eye is composed of something else. The piece is also a play on Andrew Wyeth's 1948 painting, "Christina's World," a poignant and mysterious portrayal of a woman reaching out into the distance, done from a back view. I decided to "flip" the perspective, welcoming the viewer into a new world. 

The foreground is entirely done in graphite; the background was done using graphite watercolors. I then added a digital layer of swirls and text.

Dimensions (H x W): 16" x 20"
