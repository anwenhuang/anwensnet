## Under a clear sky, I sat down to paint the lighthouse at Santa Cruz.

I created this piece using oil paints on canvas in a plein air style, or in simpler terms, outdoors and right in front of my subject. This style of painting is an entirely different feel from painting off a photograph and I was able to capture more vibrant colors as well as the live dynamic of the summer breeze. 

Dimensions (H x W): 9" x 12"
