## Done with a unique technique of "crumble then paint," this piece was definetly fun to create.

After painting the deer, I crumpled the sheet of rice paper into a ball (some of the wrinkles are still visible!). Then, when I glided my brush across with ink, the paper automatically created the rough texture of the birch trunks by only catching ink on the "peaks" of the wrinkles and leaving the "valleys" white. Everything was done using Chinese watercolors and ink on half-raw rice paper.

Dimensions (H x W): 20" x 16"
