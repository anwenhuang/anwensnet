## I painted this piece after visiting Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Although I did not visit during the fall, I felt inspired to paint a fall scene with beautiful waterfalls. The mountain background was also a creative addition. The central waterfall "bridge" was a structure highlighted at the park. The piece is done with Chinese watercolors and ink.

Dimensions (H x W): 14" x 16"
