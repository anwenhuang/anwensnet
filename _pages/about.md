### Everything has a backstory, and my interests are no exception.

I first touched a horse hair brush in second grade trying to paint an ink panda. My fingers struggled with the unfamiliar grip. In Chinese brush painting, you must hold the brush upright to allow the hairs to move flexibly. 

Further, the extremely absorbent rice paper caught me off guard, and my first paintings were blotchy and indiscernible. Yet, I was drawn to this style of painting because of how freeing it felt. There is no sketching beforehand â€” you simply dip your brush in paint and go. 

For the past decade, I have practiced this style and painted a wide range of subjects. From flowers to mountains and animals to fruits, you can check out these paintings under the [Eastern Art](https://anwens.net/tag/eastern-art/) tab. 

Heading into middle school, I discover graphite drawing. The first thing I draw is a sphere and instantly, I am captivated by the intricacy and layering required to make it realistic. In the next few years, I explore other mediums. Graphite, colored pencil, and oil paint quickly become my favorites. To see what I've created with them, just hop over to the [Western Art](https://anwens.net/tag/western-art/) tab. 

I also have a passion for statistics. This powerful tool drives our world and I was first exposed to it while studying the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on Bay Area consumer behavior. As I analyzed my data, I was amazed at how a jumble of numbers could become an impactful conclusion. You can find my statistical work under the [Publications](https://anwens.net/tag/publications/) tab. 

My passions may seem disconnected, but when you really think about it, art and statistics both help us interpret our world, if only through different lenses. And they feed curious minds, so it's no wonder that I've taken them up. 

Over the years, my curiosity has received recognition on a local, state, and national level. I've won honors such as the First Place in Northern California Chinese Brush Painting, Scholastic Art Keys, an art magazine feature, and academic panel presentations. 

I'm excited to continue exploring the world and I'm excited that you've chosen to explore mine. Have fun!
